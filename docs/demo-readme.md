# Smart Search


Smart Search is a revolutionary new web scraper search engine that employs a cutting-edge combination of Artificial Intelligence Models to deliver accurate and reliable results. With its ability to quickly adapt to changing market trends and business needs, Smart Search is set to revolutionize the way we search the web.

Smart Search is able to select the best algorithm or model to use in response to a query. It can access a variety of AI models, such as GPT-3, WolframAlpha, and BERT, as well as machine learning models like TensorFlow, Caffe2, and CNTK. Moreover, it can access image, video, and voice models such as YOLO, ResNet, Inception, R-CNN, 3D Convolutional Neural Network, FaceNet, DeepSpeech, WaveNet, and Tacotron. Lastly, it can access math models like Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression, and Random Forests.

Smart Searchâ€™s ability to leverage the power of AI across multiple domains makes it the ultimate tool for web scraping. Its advanced AI technology provides users with accurate and reliable search results that can be quickly adapted in response to changing market needs and trends. With its robust platform and flexible design, Smart Search is the premier choice for anyone looking to scrape the web.
